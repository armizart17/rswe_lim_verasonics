% DESCRIPTION : Generic function for metric calculation, extract rectangular ROI (V1.0)
% rectangular region
% INPUTS: 
%         - x   : Dim2 MATLAB (left-right) x_axis vector (only matters inital and final value)
%         - z   : Dim1 MATLAB (up-down) z_axis vector (only matters inital and final value) 
%         - cx1 : left position  
%         - cx2 : right position
%         - cz1 : up position 
%         - cz2 : down position
%         - im_in: input image
% Example Region of Interest (ROI)
%
%           (cx1, cz1)  ---------  (cx2, cz1)  
%               |                       |
%               |                       |
%           (cx1, cz2)  ---------  (cx2, cz2)  
%
% OUTPUTS: 
%         - im_out     : Output image (Only ROI values, others are NaN) 
%         - rect_mask  : Mask (ROI are '1', others are '0')
