%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Simple function for phase extraction based on Juvenal Ormachea code
% Inputs:  
%           u           : input particle velocity
%           freq        : Vibration freqeuncy
%           dinf        : Frequency range for the bandpass cuttoffs are +-
%                         2*f_band
% Outputs: 
%           M_filtered  : filtered particle velocity signal
