% DESCRIPTION : Generic function for metric calculation, extract circular ROI (V1.0)
% rectangular region
% INPUTS: 
%         - x   : Dim2 MATLAB (left-right) x_axis vector (only matters inital and final value)
%         - z   : Dim1 MATLAB (up-down) z_axis vector (only matters inital and final value) 
%         - cx  : center position Dim2
%         - cz  : center position Dim1
%         - radious  : radious
%         - im_in: input image
% Example Region of Interest (ROI)
%
%        (---- radious ----  (cx, cz)  ---- radious -----)  
%              
% OUTPUTS: 
%         - im_out     : Output image (Only ROI values, others are NaN) 
%         - rect_mask  : Mask (ROI are '1', others are '0')
